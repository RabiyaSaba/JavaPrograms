DEPENDENCY INJECTION ( DI ) DESIGN PATTERN 

Dependency injection is one of the most widely used design pattern , its comes under software design 
One of the most important related topic to dependency injection  is Inversion of Control ( IOC) 
IOC is a principle where basically we shift the responsibility from the application to an external framework or container 
Dependency injection is a way to achive the IOC 

TYPES OF DEPENDENCY INJECTION 
1.constructor injection : dependency is provided through class constructor 
2.setter injection  : dependencies are set through public setter or properties 
3.interface injection  : dependencies are injected through interface methods 

BENEFITS 
Modularity and maintainability : dependencies are clearly defined and can be easily replaced or modified without altering client code 
Testing : we can achive unit testing on it 
Loose Coupling : reduces the coupling hence making the system more easier and more flexible

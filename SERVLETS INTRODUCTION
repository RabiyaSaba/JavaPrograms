INTRODUCTION 
We all are aware of the need to create a dynamic web page 
Basically a web pages that can change the site content according to the time or that can generate the content according to the request 
In order to generate dynamic web pages in java we can make use of JAVA SERVLET 

JAVA SERVLET OF JAVA PROGRAMS THAT run on java enabled web server or application server 
Used to handle request obtained from the web servlet ,

process the request , produce the response and then send a reponse back to the web server 

 

PROPERTIES OF SERVLET ARE AS FOLLOWS 
Servlet works on server side 
Severs are capable of  handling complex request obtained from the web servers 

JAVA SERVLET ARCHITECTIRE 
 
EXECUTION OF JAVA SERVLETS

Clients sends a request to the web servers 


Web servers receives the request 



Web servers passes the request to corresponding servlets 
The servlets processes the request and generate a response the response is the output 


The servlets sends the request back to the web servers 
And webservers sends the request back to the clients and clients browser display it to the screen \

SERVER SIDE EXTENSION 

Server side are nothing but the technologies that are used to create dynamic web pages 
In order to create dynamic web pages web pages require container 
Now in order to meet this requirement we make use of APIS 
APIS are basically APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE 

APIs allows us to build somethings that can run the web servers 
Only APIS is not a technology that we can make use of servlets technology are also available which we can make use of common gateway interface 
BASICALLY CGI is an external application that is written by  using any of the programming language like c or c++
EXECUTION OF CGI 


Cgi is good to  have when handling and processing lesser request , whereas when we have more processes  we need to switch to better technology 


Servlets are build from two packages 
javax.servlets( basics) 
javax.servlets.http(advance) 



LIFECYCLE OF SERVLETS 
1.init():  it is called as soon as the request is received 
Service() :  to handle client request and redirects the request to doGet() and doPost()
Destroy() : called the request is handled , response sent back to client and finally the memory is allocated to the servlets is deallocated

JSP ARCHITECTURE 

Jsp architecture is a three tier architecture  It has client , web server and database 
Basically client is a web browser or application on client side 
Webserver uses JSP engine . i.e container that processes jsp , for example apache tomcat has a built in jsp engine 
Jsp engine intercepts the request for jsp and provide a runtime environment for the understanding and processing of jsp files 

JAVA SERVER PAGES : 
Its is a server side technology , it is used for creating web application  , it is used to create a dynamic web content 
Jsp tags are used to to insert java code in html web pages 

EXECUTION OF JSP PAGES 
 Heres how it will work 

1.	Request : when you type a web address or click on a link , your browser sends a request to the server 
2.	Server handling : the server receives the request and look for the request jsp pages 
3.	Processing : the server reads the jsp files , the jsp files basically have java embedded in html tags 
4.	Generating html : the server combines the static HTML  content of the jsp with the dynamic content generated by executing the embedded code 
5.	Response client : the generated html page is send back to the client web browser as the server response to the initial request 
6.	Client rendering : finally the client web browser renders the received html pages , displaying the content to the user

THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPERATORS IN JAVA 
1.ARITHEMATIC 
2.UNARY 
3.ASSIGMENT 
4.RELATIONAL 
5.LOGICAL 
6.TERNARY 
7.BITWISE 
8.SHIFT 
9.INSTANCE OF OPERATOR 

ARITHEMATIC OPERATOR 
USED TO PERFORM SIMPLE ARITHEMATIC OPERATIONS : 

1.	Multiplication - *
2.	Division -/
3.	Modulo -%
4.	Addition - +
5.	Subtraction â€“

UNARY  OPERATOR 
1.unary minus : used for negating the value 
2. Unary plus : showcase that the values are positive 
3.  Increment operator : increment the value by 1 (++)
There are two types of increment 
1.post increment : value is used first then increment 1++
2.pre increment : value is first incremented then used : ++1

4.Decrement Operator (--): decrement the value by 1 
Same for decrement we have post decrement and pre decrements 


ASSIGMENT OPERTOR : 

Variable = value this is known as assigmenet operator 

RELATIONAL OPERATOR : 

== : EQUAL TO 
!= : not equal to 
< : less then 
>: greater then 
<=: less then equal to 
>=: greater then equal to 

LOGICAL  OPERATOR : 

Logical and (&&) : both the condition should be true or else condition will be false if one condition is false 
LOGICAL OR  (||)  : if one condition is true then the condition is true 
LOGICAL NOT (!) :  returns true the reverse if condition is false or vice versa 

BITWISE 
 Used to perform manipulation of individual bits 
& BITWISE AND OPERATOR 
| BITWISE OR OPERATOR
